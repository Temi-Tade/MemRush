<h2>About MemRush</h2>

MemRush is a memory-based game where users are to 'remember' the specific placements of tiles/cards in order to match them with their respective pairs. Matching pairs are marked as 'collected; while non-matching pairs are flipped back to their normal positions.

One fun feature about the initial release of this game is that it can also be played by two players. Yeah, you can compete against your friends and finally end the argument of who has the better memory!
